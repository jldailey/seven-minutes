seven-minutes
=============

An assistant for doing a 7-minute interval workout.

This helps you step through the 7-minute workout,
which I read about in an [article](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout/)
in the NY Times.

The article links back to the original research publication [here](http://journals.lww.com/acsm-healthfitness/Fulltext/2013/05000/HIGH_INTENSITY_CIRCUIT_TRAINING_USING_BODY_WEIGHT_.5.aspx).

The bottom line: do 12 different exercises at maximum intensity for 30 seconds each.
